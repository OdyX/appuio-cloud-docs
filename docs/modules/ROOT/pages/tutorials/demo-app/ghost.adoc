image:logos/ghost-blog.png[role="related thumb right",alt="Demo application logo",width=120,height=120] This tutorial explains how to run {app-name} on {product}.

If you aren't familiar with issuing commands on a terminal session, we recommend familiarize yourself with it before continuing this tutorial.

== Requirements

To follow this guide, please make sure that you have the following tools installed:

`oc`:: You can download the OpenShift command directly from {product}, selecting the help menu (marked as a question mark) and selecting the "Command line tools" entry.

== About the Application

> Ghost is a powerful app for new-media creators to publish, share, and grow a business around their content. It comes with modern tools to build a website, publish content, send newsletters & offer paid subscriptions to members.

== Step 1: Create a Project

include::partial$login-in-terminal.adoc[]

. Create a new project called "[YOUR_USERNAME]-{app-name-long}-demo"
+
[source,shell]
--
oc new-project "[YOUR_USERNAME]-{app-name-long}-demo"
--

== Step 2: Deploy the application

IMPORTANT: The following steps are currently only working on the Exoscale {zone}.

To deploy the application we will use standard Kubernetes objects.
Save the example YAML Kubernetes resources into a file and apply it with `oc apply -f <myfile.yaml>`.

. First, we need a database:
+
.Database ordering from the VSHN Application Catalog
[source,yaml]
----
include::example$example-app-exo-mysql.yaml[]
----
+
This will create a MySQL DBaaS instance. See xref:appcat:ROOT:exoscale-dbaas/mysql/create.adoc[the AppCat docs] for more information.

. Then we deploy the application:
+
.Application deployment with all other needed resources
[source,yaml]
----
include::example$example-app-ghost.yaml[]
----

. Now wait until your pod appears with the status "Running":
+
[source,shell]
--
oc get pods --watch
--

IMPORTANT: This example configuration is not meant for a production ready service.

== What's next?

For a production ready service, we recommend the following parts to be implemented and configured:

* Backup with K8up
* Monitoring with user workload monitoring
* Own URL with Let's Encrypt
* Scaling?
* Requests and Limits
