= Getting Started on {product} with the OpenShift Web Console using TypeScript

image:logos/typescript.svg[role="related thumb right",alt="Programming language logo",width=120,height=120] This tutorial explains how to run applications written in the TypeScript programming language on {product} using the OpenShift web console.

If you would rather use the command line, you might want to try the xref:tutorials/getting-started/typescript-terminal.adoc[Getting Started with TypeScript on the Terminal] guide instead.

== Requirements

This tutorial doesn't require anything else than an {product} account and a modern web browser with JavaScript enabled.

== About the Application

To demo how to run applications written in the https://www.typescriptlang.org/[TypeScript] programming language on {product}, we will use a small demo application using the https://expressjs.com/[Express Framework], bundled as a container thanks to its corresponding `Dockerfile`, and ready to be used on {product}.

The "Fortune in TypeScript" application does one simple thing: when invoked on the browser, it returns a random number and a funny quote. That's all!

You can browse the full source code of this application on GitLab: https://gitlab.com/vshn/applications/fortune-typescript

== Step 1: Create an OpenShift Project

Follow these steps to create an OpenShift project and deploy the application:

. Login to {product} and open the "Developer" perspective.
. Create a new project called "fortune-typescript."
. Switch to the "Developer" perspective.
. Click the "+Add" button on the sidebar.
. Select the "Container images" option.
+
IMPORTANT: As explained in xref:explanation/differences-to-public.adoc[this page], not all options in this screen are available in {product}. In particular, it's not possible to choose the "Import from Git" option, as this requires image building capabilities that aren't yet available in {product}.

. In the "Image name from external registry" field, enter the URL of the Fortune in TypeScript container:
** `registry.gitlab.com/vshn/applications/fortune-typescript:latest`
. Change the runtime icon to match the TypeScript programming language or the Express Framework framework (if available).
. Scroll down and uncheck the "Create a route to the Application" checkbox.
. Click "Create."
. After a few seconds, you will see in the "Topology" section an icon representing the Fortune in TypeScript application running. If you click on it, you will see that there is no route to access the object.

== Step 2: Publish your Application

At the moment your container is running but it's not available from the Internet. To be able to access our application, we must create an `Ingress` object.

. Switch to the "Developer" perspective.
. Click the "+Add" button on the sidebar.
. Select the "From Local Machineâ€“Import YAML" option
. Paste and customize the code below in the editor:
+
[source,yaml]
--
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  annotations:
    cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: letsencrypt-production
  name: fortune-typescript-ingress
  namespace: fortune-typescript # <1>
spec:
  rules:
  - host: [YOUR_APP_NAME].apps.[YOUR_PREFERRED_ZONE].appuio.cloud # <2>
    http:
      paths:
      - pathType: Prefix
        path: /
        backend:
          service:
            name: fortune-typescript
            port:
              number: 8080
  tls:
  - hosts:
    - [YOUR_APP_NAME].apps.[YOUR_PREFERRED_ZONE].appuio.cloud
    secretName: fortune-typescript-cert
--
<1> Make sure this annotation matches exactly the name of your project: `fortune-typescript`
<2> Replace the placeholders `YOUR_APP_NAME` and `YOUR_PREFERRED_ZONE` with valid values.

. Click the "Create" button.
. After a few seconds, go back to the "Topology" screen, and select your container. You should see a "Routes" field now, with the clickable URL `http://[YOUR_APP_NAME].apps.[YOUR_PREFERRED_ZONE].appuio.cloud`, displaying your daily fortune cookie message!

== Step 3: There's no Step 3!

The "Fortune in  TypeScript" application is now running on {product}. Congratulations!

What's next? To run your own application written in TypeScript or using the Express Framework application on {product}, follow these steps:

* Containerize the application making sure it's compatible with {product}. The `Dockerfile` above can serve as a starting point.
* Create a deployment (in YAML format) for your application, or better yet, a https://helm.sh/[Helm] chart.
* Configure your CI/CD system to automatically deploy your application to your cluster.
* When you're done testing the fortune application, you can open the "Projects" menu in the "Administrator" perspective to delete the `fortune-typescript` project.
