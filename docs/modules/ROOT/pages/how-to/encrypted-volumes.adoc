= Setup Encrypted Volumes

This page explains how to configure encryption for persistent volumes where encrypted volume support is enabled.

== Prerequisites

For this guide, it's assumed that:

* You have `pwgen` or a similar password generator installed.
* You are logged in to your {product} project using the `oc login` command.

== On cloudscale.ch

. Ensure the `PersistentVolumeClaim` has set `spec.storageClassName=ssd-encrypted` (or `bulk-encrypted`).

. Create a `Secret` that contains the encryption key.
+
[source,bash]
----
oc create secret generic my-pvc-luks-key \ <1>
    --from-literal luksKey=$(pwgen -c -s 64 1) <2>
----
<1> The name _must_ be composed with the `PersistentVolumeClaim` name and `-luks-key` as suffix
<2> Key within `Secret` must be named `luksKey`
+
[TIP]
====
* You can also create the encryption key using files.
* If you need to manage the `Secret` via Helm you can also use the https://github.com/appuio/charts/tree/master/appuio/secret[`secret`] Helm chart.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Don't lose the encryption key!
You can't change it.
====

[NOTE]
====
The cipher used is `aes-xts-plain64` with a key size of `512`.
See more details in https://github.com/cloudscale-ch/csi-cloudscale[csi-cloudscale].
