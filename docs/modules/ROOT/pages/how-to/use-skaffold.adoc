= How to use Skaffold with {product}

image:logos/skaffold.png[role="related thumb right",alt="Skaffold logo",width=120,height=120] https://skaffold.dev/[Skaffold] Skaffold handles the workflow for building, pushing and deploying your application, allowing you to focus on what matters most: writing code.

This page will describe the required steps to use Skaffold successfully with {product}.

IMPORTANT: This information is provided as a courtesy for {product} users. We don't provide support for Skaffold, and in case of issues, you are invited to contact the developers of Skaffold at their https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/skaffold[GitHub project].

== Requirements

To follow this guide, please make sure that you have the following tools installed:

`skaffold`:: The https://skaffold.dev/docs/[Skaffold documentation] explains how to install it in your operating system of choice.

`oc`:: You can download the OpenShift command directly from {product}, selecting the help menu (marked as a question mark) and selecting the "Command line tools" entry.

`docker`:: You can download it from https://www.docker.com.

== Procedure

This section explains the steps required to use Skaffold with {product}.

=== 1. Login to {product}

include::partial$login-in-terminal.adoc[]

. Create a new project called "[YOUR_USERNAME]-fortune-go"
+
[source,shell]
--
oc new-project [YOUR_USERNAME]-fortune-go
--

=== 2. Login to the {product} Container Registry

Skaffold uses Docker to build the container image, and to publish to a container registry. In this example we're going to use the {product} integrated container registry.

. Login to the {product} container registry (as explained in xref:how-to/use-integrated-registry.adoc[this page]):
+
[source,shell]
--
oc whoami -t | docker login registry.${zone}.appuio.cloud -u $(oc whoami) --password-stdin
--

=== 3. Clone the sample "Fortune in Go" project

The "Fortune in Go" project provides a very simple Go application to start with. You can clone it from GitLab:

[source,shell]
--
git clone https://gitlab.com/vshn/applications/fortune-go.git
--

And then `cd` into it:

[source,shell]
--
cd fortune-go
--

=== 4. Add a Deployment File

Add a file named `deployment.yaml` at the root of the project with the following information:

[source,yaml]
--
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: fortune-go
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers: # <1>
      - image: registry.[YOUR_CHOSEN_ZONE].appuio.cloud/[YOUR_USERNAME]-fortune-go/fortune-go:latest
        imagePullPolicy: Always
        name: fortune-container
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: fortune-go
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: fortune-go
  strategy:
    type: Recreate
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: fortune-go
spec:
  ports:
    - port: 8080
      targetPort: 8080
  selector:
    app: fortune-go
  type: ClusterIP
---
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  annotations:
    cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: letsencrypt-production
  name: fortune-go-ingress
spec:
  rules:
  - host: [YOUR_USERNAME]-fortune-go.apps.[YOUR_CHOSEN_ZONE].appuio.cloud # <1>
    http:
      paths:
      - pathType: Prefix
        path: /
        backend:
          service:
            name: fortune-go
            port:
              number: 8080
  tls:
  - hosts:
    - [YOUR_USERNAME]-fortune-go.apps.[YOUR_CHOSEN_ZONE].appuio.cloud
    secretName: fortune-go-cert
--
<1> Remember to customize the parts marked as `[YOUR_USERNAME]` and `[YOUR_CHOSEN_ZONE]` to your liking (and according to the xref:references/zones.adoc[Zones documentation page]).

=== 5. Initialize Skaffold

Initialize the project to use Skaffold:

[source,shell]
--
skaffold init
--

Reply to the questions interactively as follows:

. Choose the builder to build image registry.${zone}.appuio.cloud/[YOUR_USERNAME]-fortune-go/fortune-go
** Docker (Dockerfile)
. Which builders would you like to create kubernetes resources for?
** Hit enter
. Do you want to write this configuration to skaffold.yaml?
** `y`

And it's ready! The file `skaffold.yaml` will contain the following information:

[source,yaml]
--
apiVersion: skaffold/v2beta26
kind: Config
metadata:
  name: fortune-go
build:
  artifacts:
  - image: registry.[YOUR_CHOSEN_ZONE].appuio.cloud/[YOUR_USERNAME]-fortune-go/fortune-go
    docker:
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
deploy:
  kubectl:
    manifests:
    - deployment.yaml
--

NOTE: Skaffold reads the URL of the container image from the deployment YAML created in the previous step, so make sure that you are properly logged in to both OpenShift and to the container registry.

=== 6. Launch Skaffold

Launch Skaffold on the terminal:

[source,shell]
--
skaffold dev
--

Skaffold should build your container image, push it to the {product} registry, and deploy your application to the cluster in a few seconds.

Now you can edit any file in your project, and as soon as you save it, Skaffold will automatically rebuild your image, push it, and redeploy it, increasing your productivity.

== Tips & Tricks

Here go some ideas to use Skaffold efficiently:

* Skaffold rebuilds your Docker image every time you save a file in your project, which depending on your setup can take a long time to finish. In that case you might want to use a separate `Dockerfile` for development, and another for production builds, where you turn on all optimizations, and strip all debug symbols away.
* Help your team adopt Skaffold by following the https://skaffold.dev/docs/workflows/getting-started-with-your-project/[getting started guide] and adding the appropriate information in your project's README file.
