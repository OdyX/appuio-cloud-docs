= How to use odo with {product}

image:logos/odo.png[role="related thumb right",alt="odo logo",width=120,height=120] https://odo.dev/[odo] is a developer toolkit to enable fast iterative application development deployed immediately to your kubernetes cluster.

This page will describe the required steps to use odo successfully with {product}.

IMPORTANT: This information is provided as a courtesy for {product} users. We don't provide support for odo, and in case of issues, you are invited to contact the developers of odo at their https://github.com/redhat-developer/odo[GitHub project].

== Requirements

To follow this guide, please make sure that you have the following tools installed:

`odo`:: The https://odo.dev/docs/getting-started/installation[odo documentation] explains how to install it in your operating system of choice.

`oc`:: You can download the OpenShift command directly from {product}, selecting the help menu (marked as a question mark) and selecting the "Command line tools" entry.

== Procedure

This section explains the steps required to use odo with {product}.

=== 1. Login to {product}

include::partial$login-in-terminal.adoc[]

. Create a new project called "[YOUR_USERNAME]-odo-go" using the `odo` tool:
+
[source,shell]
--
odo project create [YOUR_USERNAME]-odo-go
--

=== 2. Create a local folder

. Create a local folder for your project:
+
[source,shell]
--
mkdir [YOUR_USERNAME]-odo-go
--

. Jump into it:
+
[source,shell]
--
cd [YOUR_USERNAME]-odo-go
--

=== 3. Create an odo project

. Run the `odo create` command to create a new project interactively:
+
[source,shell]
--
odo create
--

. Select the following options:
** Which devfile component type do you wish to create? `go`
** What do you wish to name the new devfile component? `(go)`
** What project do you want the devfile component to be created in? `[YOUR_USERNAME]-odo-go`
** Do you want to download a starter project? `y`

You should see in your directory a file called `devfile.yaml`, following the https://devfile.io/[Devfile] specification.

=== 4. Deploy

. Deploy the code to {product} and see it in action:
+
[source,shell]
--
odo push
--

. Find the URL to access the application:
+
[source,shell]
--
odo url list
--

You can now edit the files in your project, for example the `main.go` file, and the `odo push` command will redeploy your changes to {product} automatically.

== Limitations

At the time of this writing (version 2.5.0), odo can't be used in a project with an https://github.com/redhat-developer/odo/issues/5110[existing `Dockerfile`] or an https://github.com/redhat-developer/odo/issues/5408[existing codebase]. These features may or may not be available in future versions.

The `devfile.yaml` file format documentation is located in a separate website: https://devfile.io/[Devfile].

If you encounter problems with odo, check the https://odo.dev/docs/intro[documentation] and the https://odo.dev/blog[project blog] before opening an issue in the https://github.com/redhat-developer/odo[odo GitHub project].
