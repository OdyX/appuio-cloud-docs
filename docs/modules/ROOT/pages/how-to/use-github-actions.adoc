= How to use GitHub Actions with {product}

image:logos/github-actions.png[role="related thumb right",alt="GitHub Actions logo",width=120,height=120] https://docs.github.com/en/actions[GitHub Actions] enables developers to automate, customize, and execute your software development workflows right in your repository.

This page will describe the required steps to use GitHub Actions successfully with {product}.

IMPORTANT: This information is provided as a courtesy for {product} users. We don't provide support for GitHub Actions, and in case of issues, you are invited to check the https://docs.github.com/en/actions[official documentation].

== Requirements

To follow this guide, please make sure that you have the following elements:

GitHub account:: You can create one for free at https://github.com.

`oc`:: You can download the OpenShift command directly from {product}, selecting the help menu (marked as a question mark) and selecting the "Command line tools" entry.

== Procedure

This section explains the steps required to use GitHub Actions with {product}.

=== 1. Login to {product}

include::partial$login-in-terminal.adoc[]

. Create a new project called "[YOUR_USERNAME]-fortune-go"
+
[source,shell]
--
oc new-project [YOUR_USERNAME]-fortune-go
--

=== 2. Clone the sample "Fortune in Go" project

The https://gitlab.com/vshn/applications/fortune-go["Fortune in Go"] project provides a very simple Go application to start with.

. Login to your https://github.com[GitHub] account.
. Click on the `+` sign on the top right and select "Import repository" as shown in the screenshot below:
+
image::how-to/github-import.png[]

. Enter the URL of the project:
** `https://gitlab.com/vshn/applications/fortune-go`

. Enter `fortune-go` as the name of the project in your profile.

. Clone the project:
+
[source,shell]
--
git clone git@github.com:[YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME]/fortune-go.git
--

. `cd` into it:
+
[source,shell]
--
cd fortune-go
--

. Since the code has been imported from another repository, GitHub Actions aren't automatically available. Enable them by going to the menu:Settings[Actions > General] screen and selecting the "Allow all actions" option.

=== 3. Add a Deployment File

Add a file named `deployment.yaml` at the root of the project with the following information:

[source,yaml]
--
apiVersion: apps.openshift.io/v1
kind: DeploymentConfig
metadata:
  name: fortune-go
spec:
  replicas: 1
  template:
    spec:
      containers: # <1>
      - image: registry.[YOUR_CHOSEN_ZONE].appuio.cloud/[YOUR_USERNAME]-fortune-go/fortune-go:latest
        imagePullPolicy: Always
        name: fortune-container
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: fortune-go
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: fortune-go
spec:
  ports:
    - port: 8080
      targetPort: 8080
  selector:
    app: fortune-go
  type: ClusterIP
---
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  annotations:
    cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: letsencrypt-production
  name: fortune-go-ingress
spec:
  rules:
  - host: [YOUR_USERNAME]-fortune-go.apps.[YOUR_CHOSEN_ZONE].appuio.cloud # <1>
    http:
      paths:
      - pathType: Prefix
        path: /
        backend:
          service:
            name: fortune-go
            port:
              number: 8080
  tls:
  - hosts:
    - [YOUR_USERNAME]-fortune-go.apps.[YOUR_CHOSEN_ZONE].appuio.cloud
    secretName: fortune-go-cert
--
<1> Remember to customize the parts marked as `[YOUR_USERNAME]` and `[YOUR_CHOSEN_ZONE]` to your liking (and according to the xref:references/zones.adoc[Zones documentation page]).

=== 4. Configure Secrets

To be able to communicate with {product}, GitHub Actions use secrets. And to connect GitHub Actions to {product} we're going to use a dedicated service account.

. Create a service account
+
[source,shell]
--
oc create sa github-actions
--

. Add the proper role to the service account:
+
[source,shell]
--
oc adm policy add-role-to-user edit -z github-actions
--

. On your laptop, copy the token of the service account:
+
[source,shell]
--
oc sa get-token github-actions
--

. On GitHub, select the menu:Settings[Secrets > Actions] screen and click on the btn:[New repository secret] button.
. Create the following secrets:
+
.. `REGISTRY_USERNAME`: Should be `github-actions`.
.. `REGISTRY_PASSWORD`: The token you copied in the previous step, corresponding to the `github-actions` service account.
.. `REGISTRY_URL`: The URL to the "Integrated Cluster Registry Domain" in your chosen {product} zone, as defined in the xref:references/zones.adoc[Zones documentation page].
.. `OPENSHIFT_URL`: The URL to the "Kubernetes API endpoint" in your chosen {product} zone, as defined in the xref:references/zones.adoc[Zones documentation page].
.. `OPENSHIFT_PROJECT`: The name of the project you created at the beginning of this guide, which should be `[YOUR_USERNAME]-fortune-go`.

=== 5. Add a GitHub Actions Workflow

GitHub Actions are defined in YAML, in files stored in the `.github/workflows` folder. For {product}, you can use a workflow similar to this one, with two jobs: one to build and push the container to the {product} registry, and another to deploy the latest version of the application.

IMPORTANT: Since the code has been imported (step 2 above), GitHub Actions aren't automatically enabled in your repository. Remember to enable them by going to the menu:Settings[Actions > General] screen and selecting the "Allow all actions" option.

. Create the `.github/workflows` folder in your project.
+
[source,shell]
--
mkdir -p .github/workflows
--

. Create a file named `.github/workflows/master.yml` with the following contents:
+
[source,yaml]
--
name: ci

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - 'master'

jobs:
  docker:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v1
    - name: Login to APPUiO Cloud Registry
      run: echo ${{ secrets.REGISTRY_PASSWORD }} | docker login --username ${{ secrets.REGISTRY_USERNAME }} --password-stdin ${{ secrets.REGISTRY_URL }}
    - name: Build the latest Docker image
      run: docker build . --file Dockerfile --tag ${{ secrets.REGISTRY_URL }}/${{ secrets.OPENSHIFT_PROJECT }}/fortune-go:latest
    - name: Push the latest Docker image
      run: docker push ${{ secrets.REGISTRY_URL }}/${{ secrets.OPENSHIFT_PROJECT }}/fortune-go:latest
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: docker
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v1
    - name: Login to APPUiO Cloud Project
      run: oc login --token=${{ secrets.REGISTRY_PASSWORD }} --server=${{ secrets.OPENSHIFT_URL }}
    - name: Select project
      run: oc project ${{ secrets.OPENSHIFT_PROJECT }}
    - name: Deploy application
      run: oc apply --overwrite --filename deployment.yaml
    - name: Rollout latest version
      run: oc rollout latest dc/fortune-go
--

NOTE: The workflow above uses the `ubuntu-latest` runner, which contains various developer tools ready to use, https://github.com/actions/virtual-environments/blob/main/images/linux/Ubuntu2004-Readme.md#cli-tools[including] the latest version of the OpenShift CLI.

=== 6. Push your Changes

Commit your changes in Git, as you would with any other project:

[source,shell]
--
git add . && git commit -m "Added GitHub Actions" && git push
--

Go to your project's menu:Actions[] screen, and you should see your workflow running. It should be already at work, building your container image, pushing it to the {product} registry, and deploying your application to the cluster.

image::how-to/github-actions-runs.png[]

NOTE: The first run fails because the `oc rollout` command returns an error when the application is deployed for the first time.

Now you can push any change to your project, and GitHub Actions will automatically rebuild your image, push it, and redeploy it, increasing your productivity.
