= How to use the OpenShift integrated container registry

The OpenShift integrated registry of each {product} zone is exposed outside the cluster at `registry.<zone>.appuio.cloud`.

== Prerequisites

In general, all users who have access to a namespace are allowed to

* Pull images associated with the namespace from the registry.
* Push images associated with the namespace to the registry.

TIP: Images associated with a namespace are stored in the registry under `registry.<zone>.appuio.cloud/<namespace>`.

If you need more fine-grained access control, see section <<Advanced user access configuration>> below.

== Accessing the registry with your {product} user

You can access the registry with your {product} credentials with the following steps:

. Login to the desired zone and create docker credentials for the zone registry
+
[source,bash]
----
zone=ZONE-ID <1>
oc login https://api.${zone}.appuio.cloud:6443 <2>
oc whoami -t | docker login -u $(oc whoami) --password-stdin \
  registry.${zone}.appuio.cloud
----
<1> Replace `ZONE-ID` with the zone on which you want to access the registry.
See the https://portal.appuio.cloud/zones[list of zones] for available {product} zones.
<2> You may be asked to obtain an API token from `oauth-openshift` on the zone.
If that's the case, simply follow the link and copy the resulting login command from the browser before executing the next command.

. Push an image to the zone registry
+
[source,bash]
----
project=MYPROJECT <1>
docker pull busybox <2>
docker tag busybox registry.${zone}.appuio.cloud/${project}/busybox
docker push registry.${zone}.appuio.cloud/${project}/busybox
----
<1> Select the project to which you want to push the image.
<2> The example uses the latest `busybox` image to illustrate pushing an image to the registry.
If you build your own images, just make sure you tag them as shown in the `docker tag` command.

. Check that the image has been pushed to the project
+
[source,console]
----
$ oc -n ${project} get is
NAME      IMAGE REPOSITORY                                 TAGS     UPDATED
busybox   registry.<zone>.appuio.cloud/MYPROJECT/busybox   latest   25 seconds ago
----

== Accessing the registry with a service account

To access the registry with a service account token, you need to grant the service account the `registry-editor` role.
We recommend that you create a service account which you only use to access the registry per project.
This way, you can be sure that your CI pipelines can only push images to the intended project.

. Create service account and add `registry-editor` to service account
+
[source,bash]
----
oc project MYPROJECT <1>
oc create serviceaccount image-pusher
oc policy add-role-to-user registry-editor -z image-pusher
----
<1> Select the project in which you want to create the service account.

. Extract the service account token
+
[source,bash]
----
token=$(oc sa get-token image-pusher)
----

. Use the extracted token to login to the registry
+
[source,bash]
----
echo "${token}" | docker login -u serviceaccount --password-stdin \
  registry.${zone}.appuio.cloud
----

You can use the extracted token and the command shown in the last step to push images to the zone's registry from arbitrary CI pipelines.

== Advanced user access configuration

If you want to implement more fine-grained control for registry access in your namespaces you can use the following:

* To pull from the registry, accounts need the `registry-viewer` role.
* To push to the registry, accounts need the `registry-editor` role.

Please be aware that users with role `edit` or `admin` for a namespace are granted both the `registry-viewer` and `registry-editor` roles.
Additionally, users with role `view` for a namespace are granted the `registry-viewer` role.

See the https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/registry/accessing-the-registry.html#prerequisites[OpenShift docs] for details on how to configure those roles for users.
